          This is another Oz-emanating recipe, one I
          scribbled down from a friend once after a
           gardenside, Sunday’s summer lunch. And you
           should know that I have never made it myself
            without some other friend asking me, in turn,
           for the recipe as well. Pavlova meets Victoria
           sponge is, give or take, what it is: but, as
           lazy luck would have it, much simpler to make
           than that or its ceremonious title would suggest.

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>25 grams cornflour</li>

        <div class="row">
            <p>
              Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6.
              Line, butter and flour 2 x 22cm
              Springform tins.
            </p>
            <p>
              Weigh out the flour, cornflour
              and baking powder into a bowl.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cream the butter and 100g of the caster
              sugar in another bowl until light and fluffy.
              Separate the eggs and beat the yolks into the
              butter and sugar, saving the whites to whisk
              later. Gently fold in the weighed-out dry
              ingredients, add the vanilla, and then stir
              in the milk to thin the batter. Divide the
              mixture between the two prepared Springform tins.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form, then
              gradually add the remaining 200g caster sugar.
              Spread a layer of meringue on top of the sponge
              batter in each tin, and sprinkle the almonds evenly
              over.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bake for 30–35 minutes, by which time the top of
              the almond-scattered meringues will be a dark gold.
              Let the cakes cool in their tins, then spring them
              open at the last minute when you are ready to
              assemble the cake.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whip the double cream, and hull and slice
              the strawberries; that’s to say, the bigger
              ones can be sliced lengthways and the smaller
              ones halved. Invert one of the cakes on to a
              plate or cakestand so that the sponge is
              uppermost. Pile on the cream and stud with
              the strawberries, letting some of the berries
              subside into the whipped whiteness. Place the
              second cake on top, meringue upwards, and press
              down gently, just to secure it.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you’ve got any more strawberries in the
              house, hull and halve them, and serve them
              in a dish on a table to eat alongside; it
              gives the cake a more after-lunch, less
              afternoon-tea kind of a feel, but it’s
              hardly obligatory.
