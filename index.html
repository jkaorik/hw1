              <h3>A passion for cooking</h3>
              <p>
                Hi, welcome to my blog. My name is Kim and I love experimenting in new flavors and
                recipes in my kitchen. I grew up in a small farm, in the middle of the mountains, surrounded by
                rivers and trees. As I played in the yard, a delicious smell came out through
                the window. A smell of spices, powerful, tender... home cooking. As I
                watched my grandmother cook in the wood stove, a passion emerged.

            <h3>Inspirations</h3>
            <p>Growing up among two different cultures, the Latin American and the Asian, my
              cuisine could not be less diverse. Here in this blog I try to bring not just
              part of my "memorie cuisine", but also share new references from
              places and people I meet in my worldwide travels.You should expect a touch of
              Mediterranea, Asian Fusion, and especially Brazilian cuisine. Mostly simple cooking,
              but with a touch of the classics.</p>

            <h3>Partners and Collaborators</h3>
            <p>Missy Kamaro, Antonia Silva, Kinue Yakashima, Fazenda Gennaro,Kai Fishmarket...
              some of the inumerous partners and collaborators you will find here. I believe food
              is about connections, about exchange, and good ingredients. That is why I partner with the
              best local food suppliers, and count with the collaboration of talented and
              differentiated home chefs.
